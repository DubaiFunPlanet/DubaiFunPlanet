According to Russian news source Shot, which quoted Putin's assistant Yury Ushakov, Russian President Vladimir Putin will travel to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates this week.
::

::post-paragraph
The trip is said to have taken place after all three of the Opec+ member countries decided last Thursday to voluntarily reduce their oil production by a total of roughly 2.2 million barrels per day.
::

::post-paragraph
The 2.2 million bpd number encompasses the expansion of the current voluntary reductions of 1.3 million bpd from Saudi Arabia and Russia.

According to Shot, Ushakov stated that Putin will travel to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) before proceeding to Saudi Arabia, where he would primarily hold talks with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud.

**"I hope that these will be very useful negotiations, which we consider extremely important,"** Ushakov added.

In recent years, Putin has only seldom traveled outside of the former Soviet Union, primarily to states in the region. October was his last travel beyond those nations, to China.
