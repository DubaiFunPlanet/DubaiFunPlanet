The future of urban transportation is flying taxis. a future in which the current reality of traffic jams and gridlocks disappears. In today's deadline-driven world, where vehicle traffic has increased at an exponential rate, urban transportation systems must keep up.

Flying taxis are useful in this situation. Several startups and well-established aviation enterprises are vying for a piece of the rapidly expanding electric air taxi market. Although the models are being produced in different stages, none have yet to gain popularity.

Should the German startup Volocopter's plans go as planned, the first flying taxis will arrive in Paris for the 2020 Summer Olympics. These battery-operated aerial vehicles will be buzzing around the skies of Dubai in two years. And soon, the tourism sector and air transport will undergo a transformation thanks to these little helicopters.

With two rotor blades, the Flynow aircraft resembles NASA's Ingenuity Mars chopper. It can go up to 50 kilometers at a speed of 130 km/h and emits no carbon dioxide while making the noise of a washing machine. It will function between 100 and 300 meters above the ground, depending on national limitations.

**“After the cargo version, we start producing the passenger version, the single and the twin-seater. It’s a purely automatic approach. We have three of those testing currently,”** Winter said.

Market competition for air taxis is increasing. By 2040, the market for autonomous urban aircraft is expected to be valued $1.5 trillion, according to a Morgan Stanley Research report. According to Frost & Sullivan's urban air mobility (UAM) report, air taxis will start operating in Dubai in 2022 and reach over 430,000 units by the year 2040.
