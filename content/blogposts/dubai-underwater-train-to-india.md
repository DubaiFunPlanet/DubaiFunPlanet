**You might wish to forego this trip if you're terrified of traveling deep underwater!**
::

::post-paragraph
You may assume that we have devised everything possible given the variety of transportation alternatives available, but you would be mistaken.
::

::post-paragraph
The United Arab Emirates has taken a risk by disclosing its designs for something that may make people who are afraid of deep water or claustrophobic shudder a bit uneasy.
::

::post-paragraph
Envision a train that is far below the surface of the deep blue water, speeding toward your destination while providing a view of the marine life.
::

::post-paragraph
The UAE has precisely this planned, and it's a really amazing idea.
::

::post-paragraph
A novel way for tourists to travel between Dubai and Mumbai, India, is the underwater train.
::

::post-paragraph
**However, it won't happen quickly.**
::

::post-paragraph
This 1,200-mile trip may be taken at a startling 600â€“1000 km/h as both public transportation and a means of transporting water and oil.
::

::post-paragraph
Underwater water transportation? You can accomplish it!
::

::post-paragraph
The underwater train project from Dubai to Mumbai was first proposed as a speculative proposal in 2018, but it's rapidly moving toward reality despite being extremely expensive.
::

::post-paragraph
The United Arab Emirates' National Advisor Bureau aims to close the distance between the two cities and offer something novel to the area while it is developing a plan for the railway and the kind of train required for such a trip.

**Is their aim to surpass Saudi Arabia with the launch of their smart city, NEOM?**
::

::post-paragraph
Since the massive bio project is generating a lot of excitement worldwide, it would take something fairly amazing to top the UAE's reputation for technology, infrastructure, and construction in the Middle East.
::

::post-paragraph
The ambitious project in Saudi Arabia aims to construct a 1 trillion-dollar megacity that spans from the desert to the sea, providing a biophilic refuge amidst an atypical climate.
::

::post-paragraph
Of course, an underwater train will steal the show, especially if it's finished before the NEOM project gets going.
::

::post-paragraph
With plans to finish development by the end of 2030, the bio city's construction is already under way.

Though it's a fantastic idea, the Channel Tunnel, which links the UK and France, was operational since 1994, thus it won't be the first underwater train.
::

::post-paragraph
However, instead of having brick tunnel walls, the Dubai-Mumbai train would be a visual experience, allowing passengers to glimpse the sea in all of its grandeur through see-through windows.
::

::post-paragraph
Naturally, we're going the picturesque way when it comes to Dubai, which is its greatest USP and might someday top everyone's travel wish list.
::

::post-paragraph
However, those of us who have a severe fear of the deep sea will remain at home (due to Jaws).
