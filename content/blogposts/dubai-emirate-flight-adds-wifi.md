With an expenditure of more than $350 million, the airline will provide its 50-seat A350 aircraft with cutting-edge in-flight entertainment systems that provide a remarkable, customized, and cinematic travel experience.

The only airplane displays that use Samsung's QLED technology to immerse viewers in over a billion colors are Thales' revolutionary Optiq 4k QLED HDR displays, which are part of the AVANT Up system.

**“Emirates has always regarded inflight entertainment as an essential aspect of our onboard experience, and we were in fact the first airline to put personal screens onto every single seat onboard when that was far from the norm over 30 years ago. Today, Emirates ICE remains unmatched in inflight entertainment content and experience, having won best-in-the-sky awards consecutively for the past 14 years. Our investment in next-generation Thales systems for our new A350 fleet will further our lead, enabling us to deliver even better experiences to our customers. Watch this space.”**
