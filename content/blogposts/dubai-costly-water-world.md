Dubai looks like a wonderland of water for a desert city. In a gigantic mall where penguins play in newly made snow, guests may ski or scuba dive in the deepest pool in the world. A fountain, touted as the biggest in the world, shoots over 22,000 gallons of water into the air while surrounding speakers play music in time.

However, the city depends on fresh water, which it lacks, to preserve its splendor. In order to help hydrate a fast expanding metropolis, it goes to the sea and uses energy-intensive desalination devices.
::

::post-paragraph
There is a price for everything. Due to the brackish waste produced by Dubai's desalination process and the chemicals employed in the process, experts claim that the Persian Gulf is suffering from Dubai's reliance on desalination. Moreover, it damages fisheries, coastal populations, biodiversity, and ocean temperatures along the coast.

The Gulf is facing additional challenges due to climate change and the construction of Dubai's multibillion-dollar islands through land reclamation. A $34 million private island in the shape of a sea horse is among the beachfront properties up for grabs in the man-made archipelago.

A 2021 study published in the Marine Pollution Bulletin on ScienceDirect, a website that hosts peer-reviewed research, states that if immediate action is not taken to mitigate the harm, desalination combined with climate change will raise the Gulf's coastal waters' temperature by at least five degrees Fahrenheit across more than half of the region by 2050.

Although Dubai, the most populated city in the United Arab Emirates, has addressed the damage with new technology and environmental initiatives, there is growing pressure to do more. The United Arab Emirates and other participating nations have invested in fossil fuels, which has heightened tensions surrounding the city's hosting of the United Nations global climate summit, also known as COP28, later this month.

Water is necessary for life, even without regard to Dubai's ostentatious recreational amenities. Desalination provides drinking water to a city in need. According to a 2022 sustainability report, the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority provides water to over 3.6 million residents in addition to the city's active daytime population of over 4.7 million visitors. The utility anticipates that these figures will rise by 2040, driving up demand for clean water.
::

::post-paragraph
The sustainability report states that the city desalinated about 163.6 billion gallons of water last year. An average of one and a half gallons of brine are discharged into the ocean for every gallon of desalinated water produced in the Gulf.
::

::post-paragraph
The largest facility of its kind in the world, the Jebel Ali Power and Desalination Complex in Dubai, uses pipes to extract seawater, treats it, and then distributes drinkable water into the city. However, fossil fuels power the 43 desalination plants in Jebel Ali. In 2022, the United Arab Emirates produced over 200 million tons of carbon, ranking among the world's highest per capita emissions.
::

::post-paragraph
For nearly 50 years, seawater desalination has been essential in the United Arab Emirates; however, due to severe drought, other coastal areas such as Carlsbad, California, have recently embraced this technology. Leading the nation in desalination, Florida is contemplating pipelining desalinated water from Mexico farther inland in Arizona.
::

::post-paragraph
Other Gulf nations like Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar have also long employed desalination techniques. In contrast to its oil-rich neighbors, Dubai's economy is centered mostly on tourism, real estate, and aviation, but the city's opulent architectural infrastructure was made possible by the oil boom of the 1960s and 1970s, which was short-lived.

Deep Dive Dubai is the deepest pool in the world, with roughly 3.7 million gallons of fresh water.

The world's tallest structure, the Burj Khalifa, was created by Emaar and Adrian Smith. It uses 250,000 gallons of water a day on average and needs a peak cooling capacity equal to about 10,000 tons of melted ice. Using a wastewater reclamation system developed by Hitachi, the 30-acre Burj Lake and its five dancing fountains at the base of the structure replace the water lost every day from the fountains by using the sewage from the Burj Khalifa.

The water resources of the Gulf are being strained by the development of Dubai's man-made islands. According to one study, the water's average temperature around HHCP Architects' Palm Jumeirah island rose by about 13 degrees over a 19-year period. Algal blooms, also called red tides, are an excessive growth of microscopic algae in the Persian Gulf that are linked to brine, industrial waste, and land reclamation, according to another study. Desalination plants have been forced to scale back or stop operations due to some of these harmful blooms.

Dr. Alawadi said **“Developing close to the water is much more preferred than developing in the desert landscape, and you are increasing the coastline,”**

For this article, Mr. Smith, the state-run utility, and HHCP Architects declined to comment.

In an effort to curb its massive resource consumption, Dubai has announced environmental initiatives. Among these are plans to cut water and energy consumption by 30% by 2030 and achieve 100% renewable energy by 2050. The nation has gone so far as to employ scientists to chemically induce clouds to produce rainfall (though there is little proof that this method works) and has encouraged hotels in Dubai to use atmospheric harvesting to produce their own water.

Associate professor Faisal al-Marzooqi of Khalifa University, who studies water desalination in the United Arab Emirates, claimed to have pressured officials to forbid establishments like water parks and metal manufacturing plants from using potable water for purposes other than drinking.

**“During a time when water is really valuable, there could be better ways to do things like recreational activities,”** he said.
::

::post-paragraph
He continued by saying that the water in the Gulf was already hypersaline and that the biodiversity of the region was in danger due to the rising salinity levels.
::

::post-paragraph
The average global seawater salinity ranges from 3.5 to 4.5 percent; the Persian Gulf is at the lower end of this range, which makes it more susceptible to brine. Twenty-one species of fish that depend on coral are at increased risk of going extinct as a result of the loss of about 70% of the Gulf's coral reefs. According to a 2021 study published in the scholarly journal Marine Pollution Bulletin, these changes have caused a $94 billion annual loss for tourism, aquaculture, and fisheries in the region.
::

::post-paragraph
**“This is a really big problem,”** Dr. al-Marzooqi said.
::

::post-paragraph
Mangroves and sea grass meadows are also having difficulties in this area. In addition to serving as crucial spawning grounds for economically significant species like pearl oysters, these ecosystems have the capacity to absorb significant amounts of greenhouse gas from the atmosphere and assist in stabilizing wave patterns and erosional forces. The biggest "dead zone" in the world, the Arabian Sea and Persian Gulf, is an oceanic desert devoid of the typical biodiversity caused by their decline.
::

::post-paragraph
There are now dead zones all over the world, including one in the Baltic Sea that is three times larger than Maryland, which began to appear in the 1970s.

**“We have our own in the Gulf of Mexico, where all the water going down the Mississippi deoxygenates and everything dies,”** said director of Pennsylvania State University’s Institute of Energy and the Environment, Bruce Logan.

However, Dubai is improving. Reverse osmosis is regarded as the most effective and environmentally friendly desalination technology currently in use, and the city mandated that it be used in all new desalination projects starting in 2021. Nonetheless, the majority of the nation's desalination facilities continue to employ multistage flash distillation, an outdated method.
::

::post-paragraph
Multistage flash distillation uses heat, as opposed to reverse osmosis, which uses a semipermeable membrane to force water through in order to remove impurities like salt. Though reverse osmosis can now do the same, desalination was initially explored by the United Arab Emirates because it was a more suitable technology for handling the high salinity of the Gulf. Additionally, multistage flash distillation produces a far hotter byproduct than brine, further upsetting the ecosystem even though both technologies produce brine.
::

::post-paragraph
Despite the efforts, Dubai faces criticism. **“I don’t see a lot of initiatives, to be honest,”** Dr. al-Marzooqi said. **“I feel the focus is more on renewable energy powering the systems, but there’s almost zero talk about brine.”**
