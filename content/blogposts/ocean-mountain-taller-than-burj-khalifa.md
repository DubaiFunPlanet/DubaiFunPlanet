Scientists discovered an ancient lost landscape beneath Antarctica that dates back millions of years last week, and earlier this week they announced the formation of a brand-new supercontinent that will be uninhabitable by humans.

When it comes to the inner workings of our world, there seems to be an endless number of mysteries that remain unsolved.

Speaking of illuminating the unknown, this past week a team of scientists charting the seafloor off the coast of Guatemala made yet another astonishing finding.
::

::post-paragraph
It turned out that the group had accidentally discovered a massive underwater mountain that rose to a height of 5,249 feet (1,600 meters).
::

::post-paragraph
This means that the top of the underwater peak is TWICE as high as the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, which is the world's tallest building.
::

Using a **"multi-beam echosounder"** on the Falkor research vessel, the Schmidt Ocean Institute had made their discovery.

Co-founder and institute president Wendy Schmidt said to the media as word of the mountainous discovery started to circulate, **"While there is so much we've come to understand as discoveries tumble ever faster into view, so much remains unknown in our ocean - and we are thrilled to continue exploring."**
::

::post-paragraph
The seamount is located 2,400 meters (7,874 feet) below sea level and spans an astounding 5.4 square miles (14 square kilometers).
::

::post-paragraph
The fact that the group's discovery was completely accidental is even more perplexing!
::

::post-paragraph
According to the institute's executive director, Dr. Jyotika Virmani, **"A seamount over 1.5 km tall that has up until now been hidden under the waves, really highlights how much we have yet to discover."**

**"A complete seafloor map is a fundamental element of understanding our ocean, so it's exciting to be living in an era where technology allows us to map and see these amazing parts of our planet for the first time."**

The vast array of creatures that call these underwater mountain ecosystems home, ranging from sponges to deep-sea corals, make them recognized as biodiversity hotspots.
::

::post-paragraph
A variety of invertebrates can also find homes in them.
::

::post-paragraph
Even more intriguing is the fact that, according to recent satellite-based estimates, there may be more than 100,000 undiscovered seamounts; the scientific team believes this recently discovered seamount to be just one of many.
::

::post-paragraph
As per the institute's report, it is probable that none of these will be shorter than 3,280 feet (1,000 meters).
