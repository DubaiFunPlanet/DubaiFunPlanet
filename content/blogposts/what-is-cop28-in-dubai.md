WHAT IS COP?
::

::post-paragraph
**A critical time for a transformative global action towards climate**
::

::post-paragraph
Over the past thirty years, following the Rio Summit and the establishment of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), member nations have gathered annually for the Conference of the Parties to the Convention (COP) to decide on shared goals and duties, as well as to identify and evaluate climate-related initiatives. The Paris Agreement, which was the result of the 21st session of the COP21, organized worldwide cooperation to act to adapt to the effects of climate change that are now being felt and to keep the increase in global temperature to 1.5C over pre-industrial levels by the year 2100.

There are two zones for the event
::

::post-paragraph
**(1)** The Blue Zone is a UNFCCC-managed location that is accessible to media, world leaders, accredited parties (country negotiators), and observer delegations (NGOs, IGOs, and UN Agencies). Throughout the two weeks of the conference, hundreds of official side events, such as panel discussions, speaking engagements, and cultural events, are held in the Blue Zone in addition to formal negotiations. 
::

::post-paragraph
**(2)** The COP28 UAE Presidency is in charge of overseeing and providing the Green Zone. It provides a forum for non-accredited delegates, such as youth organizations, the business community, civil society, and indigenous peoples, to be heard, encouraging discussion and understanding of climate action. 
::

::post-paragraph
In order to combat climate change, governments and the business sector need to collaborate closely, according to the UAE Presidency of the COP28. The COP28 UAE Presidency gives the corporate sector a chance to highlight their contributions to and solutions for the global climate crisis through the Green Zone. Their creative thinking, technological innovations for combating climate change, and entrepreneurial spirit will be crucial components of COP28 UAE. In addition, the Green Zone will hold technical talks, panel discussions, and events that highlight current and upcoming approaches to mitigating the effects of climate change. 
::

::post-paragraph
Many 'fringe' activities have been scheduled and held around each COP by people, companies, and other groups who either choose to host in their own locations or have not been able to get space to do so in the Blue or Green Zones. These are unofficial gatherings that have no direct connection to the COP.
