One of his most popular projects was one where he created an Arab version of the characters from Friends adorned in traditional Arabic costumes. **“The artwork featuring Matthew Perry, for example, represents a creative exploration of merging popular culture with traditions. This concept allows reimagining of well-known characters within a different cultural context, adding depth and uniqueness to the art. By infusing elements of traditional Arabic attire, the project bridges the familiar with the unfamiliar, and this approach can be seen as a creative innovation,”** says Mulloor. **“It showcases how AI art can be a powerful tool to reinterpret and celebrate cultural diversity, while also keeping a connection to global pop culture.

In Mulloor's view, artists rely heavily on their imaginative skills to conceptualize ideas, select the best data for AI training, and guide AI models toward their creative goals. **“Imagination allows artists to infuse their unique, personal touch into AI-generated art, enhancing and refining results to match their artistic style. It's also instrumental in interpreting the final artwork, helping artists convey its meaning and context to the audience. In this collaboration between technology and creativity, the artist's imagination is the element that injects the art with its creative essence, providing each piece with a distinct perspective and emotional depth.”**
