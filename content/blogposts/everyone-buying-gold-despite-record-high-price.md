Experts say that one of the primary causes of the surge in sales is consumers' expectation of rising prices. "Recently, there has been a noticeable increase in sales," stated Nishin Thaslim, Chairman of Nishka Jewelry.

**“A significant contributing factor has been the rising trend of gold prices. The market dynamics, including an upward trajectory in gold prices, have created increased demand for our products. We have observed a slight decrease in the weights purchased whereas a drastic increase in the walk in customers. As investors and consumers seek to capitalize on the favourable market conditions, our offerings, which include gold-related products, have experienced heightened interest.”**
